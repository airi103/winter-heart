# ❄️ Winter Heart

**Winter Heart** is a basic Discord bot built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [`serenity`](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) and [`poise`](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise) libraries. This project was created as a hands-on way to learn more about Rust and how it can be used to build something fun.

## ✨ Features

- Basic command handling with `poise`
- Slash command support
- Includes nicely formatted embeds

> [!NOTE]
This bot is not production-ready. It was created as an experiment rather than for practical use. It also doesn't have many commands.

### 📦Environment Variables

To run the bot you need to have two environmental variables defined. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
GUILD_ID=your_test_guild_id
```
